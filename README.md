# ``ðŸ¤– rocki``
Simple Discord Bot written in Python using Discord.py


## About
I created this bot long time ago so I don't know is it still working. Some commands are not finished and I'm not planing to end them. If you have any questions about this bot <a href="https://borox.site">DM me</a>.


## Feauters:
- Bot Blacklist
- Whitelist Guilds
- Some Animals images commands
- Python & SQL & Shell eval
**And some more!**


## Run
Run command ``pip3 install -r requirements.txt``.
Open ``config.py`` file and fill gabs with correct informations.
Run ``python3 bot.py``.
And now everything should run correctly.

> fr I'm not sure will it even run ðŸ’€
